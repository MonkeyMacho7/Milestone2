To our valued employer:
In order to use our GUI to perform the operations of the UVSim, we ask that first off download visual studio and make sure you have c# and win form downloaded as well, that is what we have written this GUI on.
We then ask that you transfer over the folder with our code and run the mainform. This will pop up our GUI on your screen and you will be able to start the UVSim.
Now keep in mind we have provided a short video of how to run our simulator so you do not get confused, but as a little written guide This will help you!
First at the top of the screen you will see a settings button, if you click it there will be a color scheme button as well, when you click that it will take you to the color picker.
You can change the primary color theme and the off color theme and hit apply to make the UVSim color scheme change based on your choice. With the UVSim, there will be a select a file button to click.
We have now added the convert file function because we wanted our UVSIM to be only for 6 digits. So now if you have 4 digit file you can click on the covert 4 digit file button and it will convert and save a new file for you that will be compatible.
After getting the correctly formatted 6 digit file you can load the file into the data grid.
Like before, you can cut, copy, paste, add row, and delete row for this simulation to run, Also if you create a new datagrid with differnt numbers, you are now able to save that new txtfile. Then when you are pleased with your new data grid, hit Start UVSim button and the simulation will start.
likewise you will see a tab control on the datagrid which allows you to run multiple files.
You will be asked to input 2 values with comma and it will run, if you would like to change files or go back to the data grid you simply just click the file button again.
